# Well hello there

Hey, I'm Noah, a young developer learning many things! Current things I'm learning:

- Python
- Bash
- C++
- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript

**Note:** almost all of my projects are private, and therefore hidden. If you're curious about any specific project, please reach out.

## Contacts

I don't have very many public contacts for obvious reasons. They are out there if you can find them. My main contact is email.
<!-- - [Email](mailto:noah@snowa.tech) -->
- [Instagram](https://instagram.com/noahsnowa)

My other secret GitHub has more contacts if you can find it. All my close friends already know it!
