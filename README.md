# Well hello there

Hey, I'm Noah, a young developer learning many things! Current things I'm learning:

- PHP
- Bash
- Python
- CSS
- HTML
- Git

## Contacts

I don't have very many public contacts for obvious reasons. They are out there if you can find them :wink:. My main contact is email.
- [Email](mailto:noah@noah.snowa.tech) - Coming Soon:tm:

My other secret GitHub has more contacts if you can find it. All my close friends already know it!
